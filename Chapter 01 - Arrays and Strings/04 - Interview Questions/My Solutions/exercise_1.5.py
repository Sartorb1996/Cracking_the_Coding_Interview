1.5 One Away:
There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character,
or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

EXAMPLE:
    pale,   ple     ->  True
    pales,  pale    ->  True
    pale,   bale    ->  True
    pale,   bake    ->  False
